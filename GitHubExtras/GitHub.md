# Working with GitHub through the website üçâ

## What is GitHub? üçè
GitHub is a web service that can be used to keep and manage software code. It is used not only to keep the code, but to update it, manage different versions of the code, share it and have multiple people collaborate on a same code-base. GitHub uses the Git system to manage the versions and track differences in the code. It is also one of the best places where a developer can host and organize their code and projects on the net. Your GitHub account can be like a portfolio for everything that you did. 

## Repository üçé
All projects and code on GitHub is organized in **repositories**. Think of repositories as folders for your projects or for organizing homework or exercises. You can create a repository and in it, you can upload different folders and files. If you upload the same files it the service will only track the changes and update the files accordingly. There are public and private repositories. Public repositories can be seen by everyone and everyone can collaborate and give feedback. Private repositories are hidden and only collaborators can see and contribute to the code. **Note** that private repositories can only have 3 collaborators at any time ( in the FREE version ). 

## How to upload something on GitHub through the website? üçç
At this stage of the academy we will only learn about uploading through the website. But there are a lot of other features that make GitHub one of the most used service for tracking code versions and keeping code. We will learn other features in the next subject. In order to upload files on GitHub we need to have a GitHub account and create a repository.
